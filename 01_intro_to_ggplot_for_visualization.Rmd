The outline, explanations, and code examples for this workshop are derived from the work found in the [Data Visualization chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) of Hadley Wickham's book entitled [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and Selva Prabhakaran's [short tutorial and Intro](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html).  When borrowing from this introduction, you should reference Wickham and Prabhakaran.
