## ggplot-intro
for MIDS Fall 2108

A gentle introduction to using ggplot2 as a visualization package.  This presentation is based on the Data Visualization chapter of Hadley Wickham's [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and Selva Prabhakaran's [short tutorial and Intro](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html)
