The outline, explanations, and code examples for this workshop are derived from the work found in the [_Data Visualization_ chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and the [_Graphics for Communication_ chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) of Grolemund's and Wickham's [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  Please reference Grolemund & Wickham as the source.  My goal with this document is to create an outline for a two hour workshop on `ggplot`.  Solutions to _R4DS_ exercises can be found in Jeffrey Arnold's [R for Data Science Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).

## Prerequisites

You'll need

- R
- RStudio
- [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/)

This tutorial assumes you already have R and RStudio installed.  Once you have launched RStudio, load the tidyverse super package of libraries:  `library(tidyverse)`.  Since the Tidyverse packages include the ggplot2 package you do not have to load ggplot2 separately.  If the `library(tidyverse)` command gives an error, you probably want to `install.packages("tidyverse")` before attaching the library.  Installation need only be done once.  Attaching the tidyverse library must be done each time your script.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```


## Basic syntax 

`ggplot` syntax template is as follows...

``` r
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))

```

- The **data** argument takes a **Tibble** (or data frame)
- The **pipe operator** for `ggplot` is a plus sign **`+`**.  

    - This is different from the rest of the tidyverse, which came later and settled on the [magritter](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) style of pipe operator:  `%>%` 
    - Tidyverse currently uses two different pipe operators, depending on the package.  The two styles of pipe operator are dependent on particular packages within the Tidyverse and are not interchangable.  
    
- The **GEOM_FUNCTION** is a function of your choosing, used to plot your visualization.

    - Some of the most common *geom_*s are scatter plots, bar plots, and box plots.  
    - There are numerous geom_functions.  At some point you will want to [browse the well crafted documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) and learn about other GEOMs.  
    
- The **mapping** function requires, minimally, the [**`aes()`**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html) function.  

    - This enables you to assign assign the variables of your data frame to the appropriate axis in your plot.

Below is a basic example.  The `geom_point()` function generates a scatter plot from the on-board **mpg** tibble, a dataset of fuel economy data compiled by the US government. `displ` and `hwy` are variables in the dataset assigned to the x and y axis, respectively.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


### The Data

As stated above, ggplot takes a tibble (data frame) for input.  Beyond identifying the data source, one has to map the variables to a geom (~ axis).  Different *geom_*s require different data types.  Understanding the definitions of continuous, categorical, and discrete variables -- as well understanding **R** data structures (factors, vectors, data/time, strings) -- will be immensely helpful to you.  You can read all about that in Grolemund's & Wickham's *R4DS* book.  Meanwhile, let's have a look at the `mpg` data we just visualized.  Look up the on-board dataset in the help:  `?mpg` to learn more about the variables.

```{r}
mpg
```

### Exercies

1. Make a scatter plot of `hwy` vs `cyl`. (Question from [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#exercises ) | [Solution](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/data-visualisation.html#exercise-3.2.4.))

## Aesthetics / Tweaking

In the book, _R4DS_, by Grolemund & Wickham the authors discuss some `mpg` data points that seem to fall outside the linear trend.  Specifically, see the blue data points below.  To investigate trends such as this, use `ggplot` to alter the levels of the aesthetics.  We'll discuss how to map the aesthetic levels throughout this workshop.  Remember, this material is presented in _R4DS_.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = filter(mpg, class == "2seater"), 
             mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy),
             color = "blue") +
  geom_point(data = filter(mpg, class != "2seater"), 
             mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy),
             color = "orange")


```


### Levels

- An **aethetic** is a visual property of objects in the plot.  For example: **shape**, **color**.

    - See Also: *size*, opacity (*alpha*), *stroke*, and more

- Each property can have different **levels**.  For example some levels of shape are *circle*, *square*, *triangle*.  By adding variables and/or changing the levels of the aesthetics you can change the visual appearance.  The effectiveness of the different aesthetics will vary with the data type.  R will often provide warnings -- suppressed in this tutorial -- depending on the quality of the mapping association.  

#### Color

Below, map a third variable, `class` to the color aesthetic.  

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

#### Shape

We can change the shape aesthetic in the same way as we changed the color.  Notice, R will only map to six distinct shapes.  (Learn more by `?pch`, or Google Search for "shapes in R")

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```

### Manual vs automatic aethetics

- Levels mapped inside the `aes()` are assigned dynamically.
- Levels mapped **manually** outside the `aes()`, but still inside the `geom_()`, are static.  This allows the coder to some flexibility.  For Example:  See below `color = "blue"` is outside the aesthetic but inside the geom function.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

### Exercises

#### 3.3.1.1 

([Question](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#exercises-1)) Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue? ([Solution](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/data-visualisation.html#exercise-3.3.1))

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

#### 3.3.1.3

Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?  [Solution](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/data-visualisation.html#exercise-3.3.3)

#### 3.3.1.4  

What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? [Soluion](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/data-visualisation.html#exercise-3.3.4)

### Aethetics revisited

#### Stroke

Above I noted that there are many different aesthetics including **shape**, **color**, *size*, opacity (*alpha*), and *stroke*.  Let's take a look at `stroke` and note two additional features...

- When using `stroke`, also use `fill`
- `stroke` may not work with every [shape](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#fig:shapes).  Check the help pages for more information

  Below the `stroke` (line thickness) is set to 3. The color of the stroke is cadetblue4.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "cadetblue4", fill = "lightgoldenrod1", size = 5, stroke = 3)
```

## Layers

### Regression Line

Like many graphics programs you can built your vector graphics in layers.  For example, add a regression line with `geom_smooth()`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


### ggplot R object

To clarify code changes, let's introduce some code changes.  All ggplot plots can be assigned as an R object.  So, for example...

```{r}
hwy_plot <- ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

hwy_plot
```

Now it will be easier to see the code changes.  Building the same layered plot as before, this time you can more easily see the code change:  `geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hwy_plot +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

### Additional Aesthetics

In the next example, notice the regression_line aesthetic operates the same as before but is applied to a categorical variable.  A third variable, `drv`, is used to highlight a new level in the aesthetic.  In this case, we'll show different levels of regression based on the categorical `drv` variable.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hwy_plot +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```

### Standard Error

Since each geom can have it's own unique arguments, consult the documentation to learn how to manipulate the appearance.  Here we can consult `?geom_smooth` and learn how to remove the standard error shading by setting `se = FALSE`.   

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hwy_plot +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
```

### Exercises

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#exercises-3

#### 3.6.1.5  

Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?  [Solution](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#exercises-3)

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```
#### 3.6.1.6

Recreate the R code necessary to generate the graphs found at [3.6.1.6](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#exercises-3) | [Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/data-visualisation.html#exercise-3.6.6)

## Facets

### facet_wrap

Facet a plot on a single discrete variable, e.g. the `class` variable that categorically identifies the type of automobile (e.g. compact, midsize, minivan, etc.)

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

### facet_grid

facet a plot on two variables

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```


## Statistical Transformations

Importantly, you need to know which geom arguments to use for your desired outcome.  Below the `geom_bar` and `stat_count` demonstrate the issue.  `geom_bar` & `stat_count` can generally be used interchangeably.

### Bar Plot

In the next sets of examples we will use the on-board dataset, *diamonds*.  Diamonds is a dataset covering various characteristics of the precious gem. You can get help on *diamonds*: `?diamonds`  

#### Automtic Categorization 

By default the `geom_bar` and `stat_count` will total the raw numbers from the data frame.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```


#### Overriding the default

As shown above performing statistical transformations by calculating summary totals for variables,  above, is a convenient default setting in ggplot::geom_bar and for other particular geom_'s. Sometimes I find it more logical to use `dplyr` (and `forcats`) to generate summary tables. However, the totals then have to be handled in a special manner after piping to ggplot (`stat = "identity`).  

##### identity 

use the pre-define totals "as is":  (`stat = "identity`)

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  count(cut) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = n), stat = "identity")
  
```


##### Proportion

generating a proportion automaticaly is super nifty...

`y = ..prop.., group = 1`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

#### Fill color

`fill = cut`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))
```


#### Stacked

`fill = clarity`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

#### Side by Side 

`position = "dodge"`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

## Jitter

`jitter` can help solve the problem of **overplotting**, as can `dodge` discussed above.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")
```

## Other geom_s 

There are a lot of options and visualizations available to you via ggplot.  The challenge becomes knowning what you can create based on the characteristics of your data.  The ggplot2 cheat sheet -- available from the **H**elp menu inside RStudio -- can help you choose the appropriate geom for your data.  Examples on the cheat sheet will lead you to choose geom_'s based on characteristics such as, one continuous variable, two continuous, one discrete + one continuous, discrete by discrete, three variables, etc.  Look closely at this useful reference.


## Coordinate System 

### Flip

default

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  mutate(class = class %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(class)) +
  geom_bar() 
```

`coord_flip()`

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  mutate(class = class %>% fct_infreq()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(class)) +
  geom_bar() + coord_flip()
```


### Mapping / GIS

Mapping and GIS is supported quite well using `ggplot` combined with the `sf` GIS package.  Interactive maps can also be generated by investigating the `mapbox` and `leaflet` packages.  Thematic maps can be generated with the `tm` package.  Census choropleths can be supported using the `tidycensus` and `tigris` packages.  If you're new to GIS I encourage you to learn more from the [Mapping in R](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/map/) resource page.  Below is an example map generated by transforming some on-board GIS data for North Carolina and found in the `demo()` package.  Some of the ggplot customizations demonstrate techniques you'll learn in the following sections of this workbook.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
demo(nc, ask = FALSE, echo = FALSE)  # Generate a sample map of North Carolina using on-board demo data

triangle <- nc %>% 
  filter(NAME == "Durham" |
           NAME == "Orange" | 
           NAME == "Wake")

tri_roid <- st_centroid(triangle)

triangle <- cbind(triangle, st_coordinates(tri_roid))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nc) +
  geom_sf(data = triangle, aes(fill = NAME)) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-78, -80), ylim = c(35.2,36.6)) +
  geom_text(data = triangle, aes(label = NAME, x = X, y = Y), size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), 
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "transparent"), 
        axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Triangle Counties in North Carolina")
```

## Color Scales

`ggplot` offers several default scales.  Scales can be used to tweak more than color.   The *Scales* section of the *Graphics for Communication* chapter ([R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html)) should be read for understanding.  You can tweak the aesthetics for continuous, discrete, datetime, or date variables.  Scales are also used to change axis breaks, labels and legends.)  

**Color scales** are often used to change color for **improved visual clarity.**  Two of the most common packages for this are the `RColorBrewer` and `viridis` packages.  Below the "Dark2" palette option from the RColorBrewer set is associated with the categorical `mpg$class` variable.  Aside from "Dark2", find the names of other ColorBrewer palette names in many places: `?scale_color_brewer`, Google, R4DS, etc.

`scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")`

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")  

```

Viridis may work better for continuous variables, rather than discrete.  However, below is an example of the viridis package changing the color scale.

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE)
```

Below is another example this time using a continuous variable, `diamonds$price` to demonstrate  color.  The first plot uses the ggplot default.  

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = price))
```

The second plot uses the viridis package to override the default color scale.  (Aditionally, the alpha aesthetic is mapped to better represent overplotting.)

`viridis::scale_color_viridis()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = price, alpha = price / 10000)) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis() +
  guides(alpha = FALSE)
```

## Legends

You can alter the position or existence of legends.  Positions include "top, bottom, left, right, and none".  

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

You can control other aspects of the legend's appearance as well.  Here we control the number of rows displayed with `guide_legend(nrow =1)`

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1))
```


## Labels:  Axis / Markers / Ticks

### Titles, subtiles, and captions

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency Ratings",
    subtitle = "Highway mpg as a dependency of Engine Displacement",
    caption = "Data from www.fueleconomy.gov"
  )
```

### Axis & legend titles

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  labs(
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    color = "Car type"
    )
```

### Axis ticks & breaks

Suppose you want the y axis to be listed in increments of 5 rather than the default.  See below.  **Alternatively, remove the axis lables** with code such as:  

- `scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL)`
- `scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL)`

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 40, by = 5)) 
```


## Annotations

While Annotations can help you highlight your data story, the execution of the annotation is a bit persnickety.  *R4DS* recommends the following approach which accommodates requirements for the same x & y variables.  This requirement for sameness in data frame will help draw axes scales within expected limits.  Follow the format presented here and read the explanation in the _R4DS_ book as you experiment with Annotations.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
annotation <- mpg %>%
  summarise(
    displ = max(displ),
    hwy = max(hwy),
    label_text = "Average fuel economy skews higher when\nincluding light-weight two-seater sports cars."
  )

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label_text), 
            data = annotation, 
            vjust = "top", hjust = "right",
            color = "coral1") 
```

### Just for Fun

Let's attempt to make the story clearer by adding regression lines along with titles, subtitles, captions and annotations.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label_text), 
            data = annotation, 
            vjust = "top", hjust = "right",
            color = "coral1") +
  geom_smooth(data = mpg %>% filter(class != "2seater"),
              se = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, color = "coral1", se = FALSE, linetype = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency Ratings",
    subtitle = "Dashed line for all car types, Solid line excludes 2seater class",
    caption = "Data from www.fueleconomy.gov"
  ) 
```


## Themes

Using the `theme()` function, you can customize your visualization extensively.  Above, in the **Legends** section we used `theme()` to selectively move the position of the legend.  Beyond that you can alter the appearance of your visualization with several pre-configured themes. (See image from the **R4DS** book, below.)  A fuller explanation of themes can be found in *Graphics for communication* chapter of *R for Data Science* by Grolemund & Wickham. If you like to tweedle, `themes()` is a great function to explore further.  

![Image Credit: Themes from _R for Data Science_ by Grolemund & Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/visualization-themes.png)

` theme_bw()`

```{r}
hwy_plot +
  theme_bw()
```


### Gridlines

Many people ask about removing gridlines.  At this point let's just say it's easy and there's plenty of documentation on how to do it (e.g. `theme_classic()` or search Google, Stack Exchange, etc.).  The one exception to basic gridline management is when using geom_sf.  See the **Mapping / GIS* example above for some rather obscure documentation on how to handle gridlines and axes with `geom_sf()`.


## Saving

`ggsave()` will save your existing visualization to disk.  **However**, when you compose your code using  R Markdown (and `knitr`), you can knit your literate code and integrate your dynamically produced visualizations into your reports, all without separately saving your image to disk.  Read more about [R Markdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) or browse the [R Markdown support pages](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## Extending ggplot packages  

Extra cool and special packages

- `RColorBrewer` -- highly visible color palettes
- `viridis` -- like `RColorBrewer`, this is a color scale tool especially tuned to visibility issues for for continuous data
- `ggrepel` -- adjust labels to prevent overlap
- **Annimation**:  use `gganimate`to [animate](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate) plots with motion
- **Interactivity**:  use `plotly` to turn your visualization into an interactive, publication-quality, online experience
- Gallery of other extra cool [ggplot extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/)
